 -f,--format <arg>      Input format, use t for tab and c for comma.
                        Default is c. Any other character or string will
                        be used as-is
 -h,--help <arg>        Command line help
 -i,--input <arg>       Load data from input file
 -o,--output <arg>      Write data to output file, or if not provided
                        write to stdout
 -p,--operation <arg>   The operation to perform, one of: json2xml,
                        xml2json, trim, tolower, toupper, hashcode. Separate with |
                        to run multiple filters. Filters are executed left
                        to right as they are specified in this argument
 -t,--target <arg>      Target column to modify, numeric index
 -v,--verbose           Show verbose log output
```

## Currently supported filters are:

* json2xml,

* xml2json, 

* trim, 

* tolower, 

* toupper, 

* hashcode,

* removewhitespace, 

## ToDo:

* Instead of one column to be transformed, allow for multiples and ranges
* Allow arguments to the filters
* Add specific help for a filter/operations
* Generate a report in a file that provides details of what was done to each row with any exceptions and failures
* Allow operations to add a column instead of working in place
